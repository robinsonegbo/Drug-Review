Analysis of patients' reviews to improve drug administration
H1: Reviews have a negative effect on the usability of a drug.
H0: Reviews have no negative effect on the usability of a drug.
4.0 Findings
From the analysis of drug reviews, it is found that there is a significant relationship between the frequency of drug review to the frequency of uniqueID and the frequency of usefulCount to a reviewed drug (p < 0 and p<0.005, respectively).
Specifically, we found a 72.88% decrease in the frequency of uniqueID for every 1% increase in drug review, and a 21.49% increase in the frequency of usefulCount for every 1% increase in drug review. Therefore, we accept the null hypothesis because reviews have a negative impact on the usability of drugs.
4.1 Conclusion
User reviews by patients provided an additional perspective on pharmaceutical tolerance. The drugs examined were not unexpected, and they included many of the most often prescribed treatments for each illness. An examination of reviews over time revealed a significant increase between 2014 and 2016. Many of the most common side effects were linked to adverse drug occurrences reported to the FDA using internet reviews and sentiment analysis. The FDA seemed to have significant and treatment-modifying effects, whereas user reviews are likely to emphasize the mental health effects of commencing a new therapy.
